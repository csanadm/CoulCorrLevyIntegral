# CoulCorrLevyIntegral

 Coulomb correction integral calculation based on a Levy source

## Description
This package contains a calculation for quantum-statistical correlation functions, including Coulomb-correction, based on analytic results and a final numerical integration. For the calculation to work, the `boost` library is needed, although the numerical integral can be programmed by the user as well.
