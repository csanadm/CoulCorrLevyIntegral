# CoulCorrLevyIntegral

 Coulomb correction integral calculation based on a Levy source

## Description
This package contains a calculation for quantum-statistical correlation functions, including Coulomb-correction, based on analytic results and a final numerical integration. For the calculation to work, the `boost` library is needed, although the numerical integral can be programmed by the user as well.

- [**Makefile**](https://github.com/csanadm/CoulCorrLevyIntegral/blob/main/Makefile): Using `make all`, it will create an executable

## Example results
The below example has been created using the output from [calc_func.cc](https://github.com/csanadm/coulcorrlevyparam/blob/main/calc_func.cc)
